English and Spanish are very similar; so similar that many sentences can be accurately translated word-by-word. For example, 'I want white chocolate' is 'Yo quiero chocolate blanco' in Spanish. The translation is so straightforward that one word is exactly the same!

Being a native Spanish-speaker, I have used this similarity countless of times. However, lately I realized that I must be careful, lest I choose a word that _sounds_ similar yet means something _extremely_ different. A few examples:

|                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Exalted](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/exalted): high or elevated in rank, position, dignity, etc. | [Exaltado](http://www.wordreference.com/definicion/exaltado): que se exalta o excita con facilidad, extremo en su actos y opiniones. |
| [Indolence](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/indolence): habitual laziness; sloth.                    | [Indolencia:](http://www.wordreference.com/definicion/indolencia) incapacidad de conmoverse o sentirse afectado por algo.            |
| [Terse](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/terse): brief and to the point; effectively concise.         | [Terso](http://www.wordreference.com/definicion/terso): liso, sin arrugas.                                                           |

There is no doubt that an exhaustive list would include dozens (or hundreds) of words. Therefore, the following lesson stands: gotta be careful with word-choice, _hermano_.

Note: Yes, I chose the first definition of each word. Words like 'Terso' or 'Indolencia' do have the same meaning as their English counterparts, but only if their obscure definitions are considered!
